## Crossband to TGIF, Yaesu Fusion

I Crossband to other networks using the DMR Overlay Scheme of pi-star. The convention used by this DMT Overlay Scheme is: BrandMeister Talk Groups are in their correct place, 1-999999 etc., DMR+ has the "8" prefix, and stretched to 5 digits, finally TGIF is expected to live on DMRGateway slot 4, and has the "4" prefix (and stretched to 7 digits total).

Please see more details and discussions here: [pi-star DMR Overlay Scheme Proposal and Discussions](https://forum.pistar.uk/viewtopic.php?t=2730 "pi-star DMR Overlay Scheme")
